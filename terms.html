  		<p>You have to agree and follow all steps provided. You should be ready to recieve help and ready to help others</p>
  		We value the support that the public provides for the mission of The Sanders Foundation Foundation by visiting our organization's website, giving what they are able, and telling others about it. So that we may better assist you, you may be asked to list your name, address, and other information if you wish to participate in The Sanders Foundation or apply for available financial aid. Our policy with regards to your personal information is listed below.

<h2>Information we collect about our Donors and Applicants</h2>

<p>The Sanders Foundation asks persons who wish to interact with the The Sanders Foundation website to register with the organization. During the voluntary registration process, persons are required to provide their names, physical addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Additionally, as a part of our application process, we may request that applicants provide us with a series of documents in support of their applications for assistance. These documents will vary from case to case but generally will include, at minimum, a copy of a state-issued photo ID, proof of income, proof of employment, proof of housing cost, or other types of documentation as deemed necessary to verify the details of a particular application for assistance.</p>

<p>Federal and state laws regarding the retention of documents by non-profit organizations require that we keep any documentation submitted to us by an applicant during the application process for a period of six years.

The Sanders Foundation collects, encrypts and securely stores this information for the sole purposes of a) contacting those people whom the organization believes it can assist; b) controlling against fraudulent activity, both against registered users of the The Sanders Foundation website and against the organization itself; and c) communicating with both our donors and our applicants, as necessary and appropriate, unless an individual has specifically requested that he or she receive no correspondence from the organization.</p>

<p>The Sanders Foundation does not use other software or hardware techniques to collect other information that could be used to personally identify visitors to The Sanders Foundation without their knowledge.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>The Sanders Foundation has a strict policy of protecting your personal information.

The Sanders Foundation will take all reasonable steps to protect its users' personal information and to protect them from unwanted correspondence/solicitation made as a result of a visit to or decision to register with The Sanders Foundation. Our website and database are secured with state-of-the-art digital certificates and can be accessed only from certain authorized computers physically located in our office. For this reason, any personal data that you submit to The Sanders Foundation is maintained as securely as current technology will allow. However, it is important to remember that, by their very nature, transmissions made via the Internet can never be absolutely secure.</p>

<p>With regard to our donors, The Sanders Foundation will not sell, rent, share or disclose personally identifiable information regarding our donors to any commercial entities, marketing firms or non-profit entities.

With regard to our applicants, The Sanders Foundation will not sell, rent, share or disclose personally identifiable information regarding our applicants to any commercial entities, marketing firms or non-profit entities except a) in the event that such information is formally requested from us by a legal entity or law enforcement agency; or b) it is necessary to share such information in order to fund a request for assistance. In the event that it is necessary to share an applicants personal information with a third party in order to fund an application for assistance, we will do so only with the explicit, written consent of the parties involved.</p>

<h2>Publicly Sharing Your Comments</h2>

<p>The Sanders Foundation receives thousands of requests for help every month, along with many letters asking general questions, commenting on The Sanders Foundation, or with information from persons who have received assistance from the organization. The details of these requests for help and other comments and questions may be shared freely among The Sanders Foundation' staff as necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p>In addition, The Sanders Foundation makes it possible for persons who request help from the organization to make the details of their request (exclusive of their personally identifiable information) available to other registered users of The Sanders Foundation. The Sanders Foundation likewise makes it possible for persons who have received help from The Sanders Foundation to post a short note to The Sanders Foundation' testimonials page.</p>

<p>However, the choice to make the details of an application for help public or to post a testimonial is made on an individual basis by our applicants themselves. The Sanders Foundation will not post or permit the posting of information in any way that specifically identifies the sender(s) of that information under any circumstances.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us Regarding Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding The Sanders Foundation Foundation's Privacy Policy or would like either to review or request an update to your personal information on file with The Sanders Foundation, please contact us either via email or by telephone. We will promptly respond to your request.</p>
